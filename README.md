## Cleaning, Analyzing, and Visualizing a Business Dataset
### Overview
- In this project, I took a large, unformatted dataset and transformed it into a meaningful and actionable report through three key stages: data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization. The project simulates a real-world scenario where a manager needs insights from a messy dataset, and I provide the necessary steps to clean, analyze, and visualize the data using Excel and Power Query.

## Key Features
**1. Data Cleaning with Power Query**
- The first part of the project focuses on preparing the data for analysis. **Power Query** is used to automate repetitive cleaning tasks, ensuring the dataset is consistent and error-free.
  - **Removing duplicates:** Ensured no duplicate records in the data by eliminating redundant order IDs.
  - **Date formatting**: Converted date columns to a standard date format for consistency.
  - **Merging columns**: Combined first and last names into a single column for cleaner representation.
  - **Handling numerical data**: Rounded the "Units Sold" column to whole numbers to reflect realistic business scenarios.
  - **Standardizing text**: Capitalized and trimmed extra spaces in the "Salesperson" column to ensure uniformity.

**2. Data Analysis**
- Once the data is clean, the next step is to perform analysis to answer specific business questions. Using Excel's Descriptive Statistics and Pivot Tables, the dataset is analyzed to provide insights.
  - **Summary statistics**: Calculated key metrics such as average, minimum, and maximum revenue to understand overall business performance.
  - **Revenue breakdown by salesperson**: Created a Pivot Table to determine which salespeople were generating the most revenue, sorting the data for easy interpretation.
  - **Revenue by gender**: Used another Pivot Table to analyze which gender contributed more to sales, displaying the percentage of total revenue.

**3. Data Visualization**
- Finally, we present the data in an easily understandable way using visualization tools.
  - **Conditional formatting:** Applied data bars to visually represent the proportion of revenue generated by each salesperson.
  - **Scatter plot:** Created a scatter plot to explore the relationship between customer age and revenue, with a trend line and equation to highlight the correlation.
